    - bug fix for 794536

version 0.4:
    - filters allow patterns to match on supertypes and basic class attributes
    - severity levels allow rules to generate warnings instead of errors
    - XML reporting
    - message rules
    - from / to vars now available in access rule patterns as well as messages
    - added from-package / to-package vars
    - "regex" deprecated in favor of "class" (will make future features more readable)
    - ForEach now checks more than just the primary classes
    - better-structured event callbacks (inching closer to IDE integration)
    - Macker now uses BCEL for class parsing
    - parsing for superclass, interfaces, access modifiers
    - parsing distinguishes different types of signature-level reference
    - Macker now forces validation against its internal DTD

version 0.3.1:
    - added a few examples
    - fixed broken links in docs

version 0.3:
    - Macker now detects API-only accesses of other classes
    - rulesets now support input class subsetting
    - access rules now support custom error messages
    - Ant task supports custom classpath without forking
    - vast performance improvements through better regex caching
    - much-improved API for calling Macker from Java
    - addReachableClasses supports dynamic primary class detection
    - Macker now won't stop after the first ruleset that fails
    - bug fix for vars containing other vars
