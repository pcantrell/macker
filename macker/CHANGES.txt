version 0.3:
    - Macker now detects API-only accesses of other classes
    - rulesets now support input class subsetting
    - access rules now support custom error messages
    - vast performance improvements through better regex caching
    - much-improved API for calling Macker from Java
    - addReachableClasses supports checking from classpath (good for JUnit)
    - Macker now won't stop after the first ruleset that fails
    - bug fix for vars containing other vars
    - added void to primitive types (now necessary b/c of API parsing)
    - numerous output formatting tweaks (getting readable!)
