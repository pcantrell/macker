<h2>About Macker</h2>
<p>
Macker is a build-time architectural rule checking utility for Java developers. It's meant to model the architectural ideals programmers always dream up for their projects, and then break -- it helps keep code clean and consistent.  You can tailor a rules file to suit a specific project's structure, or write some general "good practice" rules for your code.  Macker doesn't try to shove anybody else's rules down your throat; it's flexible, and writing a rules file is part of the development process for each unique project.
<!--
Most every enterprise software project has an architecture: a set of roles, layers, patterns, and tools designed to make the application successful.  Unfortunately, the very forces which create a need for architectural consistency -- large codebases, large development teams, and long-term maintenance -- cause implementations to drift from the architecture and become inconsistent over time.

Macker is a tool which helps control this problem.  It is an aspect-oriented architectural rule checker: it groups classes based on cross-cutting patterns, then applies a set of dependency rules to those patterns.  Both the patterns and the rules are expressed in a project-specific rules file, which models the project's intended architecture.
