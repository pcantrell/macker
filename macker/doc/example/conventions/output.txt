________________________________________________________________________________

This example demonstrates the use of Macker to build patterns from, and to
enforce, the implementation conventions of classes in different roles.

In this example, instead of using a naming convention to separate API from impl,
the rules file considers interfaces in the project to be APIs, and the classes
which implement them to be impls.  The rules are contrived to highlight the
filters added in version 0.4.

Macker's ability to enforce implementation conventions remains somewhat limited,
as two important features don't exist yet:

   * Macker currently only supports access rules, which deal with dependencies
     between classes.  New kinds of rules which deal with each class taken by
     itself, rules with forms like "all X must match Y", will tie implementation
     features and naming conventions together.  This is tentatively on the plate
     for version 0.5.

   * The current set of filters is limited to basic attributes of classes.
     Future filters will support more sophisticated matching, e.g. "classes with
     a private constructor" or "class which expose floating-point primitives on
     public or protected method signatures".
