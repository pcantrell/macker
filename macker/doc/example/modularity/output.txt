________________________________________________________________________________

This example demonstrates how to use Macker to enforce modularity rules between
a collection of functionally separate peers with a parallel structre.

The example code is a game simulation program with several different computer
players which can play one of two games (Prisoner's Dilemma or Rochambeau).  The
games don't know about the various players, and the players don't know about the
game; the two modules communicate through APIs, and hide their implementations
in "impl" packages.

The macker rules file (src/macker.xml) looks for modules using a <foreach>, and
the checks that other classes are using each module through its API.  The class
BrokenMain breaks this rule by instantiating impl classes directly, so it will
give some errors.
