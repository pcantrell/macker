________________________________________________________________________________

This example shows how Macker might check a layered/n-tier architecture.  The
code contains a program with UI, model, and persistence layers.  Each is
supposed to talk to the next layer down; in addition, anybody on the outside can
talk to the model.

The example code contains a problem: the thoughtless author of the model layer
is passing through exceptions from the persistence layer, forcing the GUI to
illegally reference PersistenceException.

You can fool around with the various ways one might fix this problem, namely:

  * Declare a new model-level exception, and wrap PersistenceException in it.
  * Make PersistenceException extend RuntimeException, and stop checking it.
  * Declare a special exception to Macker's rules for exceptions.

I don't necessarily endorse any of these as aesthetically valid options, but
Macker can deal with them all!

If, for some absurd reason, you want to run this example, you need to edit
conf/db.properties and then put the conf directory in your classpath.  You also
need to create a table named "thinger" with one varchar(255) column, "name".
