________________________________________________________________________________

This stupidly simple example disallows references from classes whose names
contain "Print" to any Java APIs.  As with most of these examples, the source
code contains a few violations of the rules, so you can see what such violations
will look like.  Note that Macker picks up several references in this example
that aren't immediately obvious.

With all of these examples, you can:
  * Type "ant" to see macker apply the rules
  * Type "ant -Dmacker.verbose=true" to see some details of what's going on
  * Edit "src/macker.xml" to fool with different rules
  
Enjoy!
